# Harness Native Transport

## Description
Microservice (TCP) for interfacing with native OS. This should be the only variable piece of the hub ecosystem allowing the for low barriers to compatibility. 

## Support
Only compatible with Ubuntu 22.04 (jammy) right now.

## Moving Forward
As we broaden our OS support I think we will keep it in a single repo and build OS-specific tagged containers.
